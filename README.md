This repository serves as a **technical documentation hub** for my CompTIA A+â€“aligned hardware labs and simulations. It demonstrates not only my hands-on experience with system components, peripherals, and repair workflows, but also my ability to document, categorize, and reflect on incidents in a ticketing-style format.
