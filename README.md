**Author:** Errol de Jesus  
**Focus:** IT Hardware, Ticketing, and Troubleshooting Documentation  
**Active Period:** 2025â€“2026  

## Overview
This repository serves as a **technical documentation hub** for my CompTIA A+â€“aligned hardware labs and simulations. It demonstrates not only my hands-on experience with system components, peripherals, and repair workflows, but also my ability to document, categorize, and reflect on incidents in a ticketing-style format.

## Goals
- Develop clear and concise **incident documentation** skills.
- Translate **lab simulations into real-world troubleshooting workflows.**
- Build a foundation for future **Helpdesk and Cybersecurity Ops** repositories.

## Repository Sections
- **Hardware-Labs:** Technical step-by-step documentation of A+â€“aligned hardware tasks.  
- **Reflections:** Personal insights linking each lab to real-world support environments.  
- **Templates:** Standardized markdown formats for ticketing and reflection entries.
