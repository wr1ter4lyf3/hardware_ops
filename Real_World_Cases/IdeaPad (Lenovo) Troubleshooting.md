Background: I purchased the Lenovo IdeaPad back in 2021 from Office Depot. At some point, the laptop began to overheat constantly, as well as not charge, despite the adapter being plugged in. 
I purchased a new laptop back in 2022, but after beginning my A+ course, I decided to try troubleshooting my old Lenovo to get more experience troubleshooting laptops in general. <br>

The following recounts the steps I took to better understand the hardware issues and what eventually led me to my conclusion that the laptop will need a new battery. 

# 🛠️ Problem-Solving Workflow

✅ Step 1: Inspected the Old Lenovo Laptop

🔋 1. Power Port Label – JDCIN1

"JDCIN1" = DC-IN Jack--Where charger plugs into the motherboard. 

This was good to know because now I could search for the correct replacement power brick by referencing the Lenovo model number + “JDCIN1 power adapter”.

I grabbed the model number to help ID a verified compatible charger.

💾 2. M.2 XL 3.5 Label

The M.2 slot could install an M.2 SSD in addition to or instead of the 2.5" hard drive you currently have installed (that’s the Toshiba HDD at top left).

If I wanted to upgrade this machine later, this would be my pathway to faster storage.

📦 3. That EC1JV000200 Plate

Blank shield or cover plate, often just there to cover unused optional connectors or components. It might normally be labeled for manufacturing, not function. 

That number (EC1JV000200) is likely:

• A Lenovo part number for internal tracking

• Possibly associated with the keyboard or touchpad connector region

So no need to stress about it—it’s probably not something you need to interact with directly.

🧩 Salvageable: Mobo looks intact, the SATA drive is secure, the fan’s clean-ish, and I've got expansion potential.

🧰 Next Steps
Power it on again	
Get the correct Lenovo charger
Back up data	Use the SATA-to-USB cable
Clean and restore it	Buy a laptop screw kit + thermal paste (if repasting later)
Boost performance	Consider replacing HDD with SSD or adding to M.2 slot
Get real nerdy	Install a clean Linux distro or Windows from USB (to test fresh performance)

How this relates back to A+: 

• Component labeling (JDCIN1, M.2)

• Fan and CPU heatsink structure

• SATA ports vs M.2 slots

• Power diagnosis

• Screws and casing

Plugged it in with the new charger to see:

🔌 Does it power on?

🔋 Any battery charge at all?

🧼 Does it boot to OS, BIOS, or nada?

✅ Step 2 Took note of:

Any beeps, lights, fan spins

Screen output (if any)

This told me how deep the fix needs to go—-could just be a battery/bios thing, or something deeper.

### Findings:

The wrong power adapter was purchased--no judgment, I previously purchased the wrong charging adapter as a misinformed consumer. That was a reactive rather than proactive troubleshooting attempt. 



⚡ Lenovo IdeaPad: No Power

🧠 Symptom: Light blinks briefly, then dies. No boot.

1️⃣ Power Adapter Test

Lenovo powered on only when plugged in and died instantly when unplugged:

• Battery is probably dead or disconnected

• Could still use it as a desktop mode laptop while plugged in or source a replacement battery later...


2️⃣ Battery Bypass Test

🔌 Remove the battery (if removable).

🔋 Plug in the charger without the battery.

💡 Try powering on.

If it turns on → Faulty battery.

If it still doesn’t → Proceed to Step 3.

3️⃣ Static Discharge Reset (good ol’ IT trick)

🔌 Unplug charger.

🔋 Remove battery (if possible).

🔘 Hold power button for 30–60 seconds to discharge any residual power.

🔌 Plug charger back in (still no battery).

🔘 Try powering on again.

4️⃣ Battery Check (if removable)

📦 Look for bloating, cracks, or burn smell.

📉 If it’s a slim internal battery, check for loose ribbon cables or warping (you’d need to open it up for this).

5️⃣ CMOS Reset / Internal Inspection

🧰 If you're open to opening it up:

Check the CMOS battery (little coin cell).

Check for corrosion, loose ribbon cables, or burns around the DC-in board and motherboard.

If it’s not removable or you’re not comfy doing this: we can pause here or find a shop that can run basic diagnostics for cheap.

The original Lenovo laptop showed no signs of life even when plugged in.



Diagnostic signs included:

Purchasing the correct power adapter

Brief charging light when the power adapter was plugged in, followed by immediate shutdown.

No POST or BIOS splash screen on power-up attempt.

Action: Removed the internal battery to investigate further.

Model: L16C2PB1

Rated Capacity: 4510 mAh

No swelling, but non-responsiveness likely points to battery degradation or internal power circuitry failure.
